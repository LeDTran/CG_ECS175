AFTER READ IN DATA
-need to calculate Ip for each vertex in each poly and store them

SORTING FACES
-sort by poly first
-then member function reorder facep1/2/3 depending on window view\
	-reorder by AVERAGED facep1/2/3
	-make sure reorder face normals accordingly
-reset poly's faces vector
-create new faces with reordered facep1/2/3
	-when push back on faces vector, faces will be same order as facep1/2/3
	-make sure to pass in vertex phong model intensities
-now faces will be in order for rasturization
