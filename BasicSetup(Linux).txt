If you only want to use Linux based system (Fedora, Ubuntu...) to develop your project, 
please use the following setup.

If you are using Fedora on CSIF computers, skip to Compiling step, GLUT and OpenGL is already installed

-Install C,C++ compiler
	- Open "Terminal" and enter:
		>sudo apt-get install build-essential
		might have to first do:
			>sudo apt-get update
		
- FreeGLUT and OpenGL
	- Install FreeGlut and OpenGL
		>sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

-Compiling, if there's only one source file (replace sample.cpp with your source file name)
	>g++ sample.cpp -lglut -lGL

If you have more than one source file, you might need to use multiple compiling commands or a makefile.
